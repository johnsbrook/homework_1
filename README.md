# HTML CSS Code Refactor 

You'll find a simpler HTML and CSS code with comments on each of the changes made in both files. Here are the changes: 

* The different parts of the HTML code have been changed to semantic tags and the code has been separted into cleaner and condensed parts. 

* The visual structure has largely remained the same; 

* img tags now include alt with image description;

* Images and elements will not overgrow when the website is maximized;

* Navigation bar is functional and will take you to the requested section;

* Both, main and aside tag's height matches from top to bottom when resizing browser.
